Exponential moving average is a typw of moving average that places a 
greater weight and significance om the most recent data points. EMA 
is also referred to as the expoonentially weighted moving average. 
EMA react more significantly to recent price changes than simple 
moving average, which applies an equal weight to all the observations 
in the period. Durations, either in days or hours or minutes are used 
to create indicators like the moving average convergence divergence 
and percenrage price oscillator.

Traders who employ technical analysis find moving averages very 
useful when applied correctly. Moving averages are lagging 
indicators. For this reason the conclusions drawn from applying a 
moving average to a paticular market should be to confirm a market 
move. One may use an EMA to derive a trading entry signal.

EMA is better suited for trending markets. The indicator lines show 
trends (up or down) and may also be used to determine the rate of 
change from one bar to the next (indicator lines). This rate of 
change may be used to forcast an entry/exit signal. This form of 
indicator analysis counters the lagging effect of using a moving 
average indicator.
